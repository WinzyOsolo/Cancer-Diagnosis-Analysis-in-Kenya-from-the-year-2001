# Cancer-Diagnosis-Analysis-in-Kenya-from-the-year-2001
The objective of this data science project is to analyze and derive inights on the diagnosis and prevalence of Cancer in Kenya from the year 2001. The project aims to create  value to various stakeholders within the healthcare industry, medical researchers, the Kenyan government and the World Health Organisation. This research is important because the the better we understand this disease, the more progress we will make as a country in diminishing the tremendous human and economic tolls of cancer.

  -Develop safe and effective methods to prevent, detect and diagnose, treat and ultimately, cure the collection of disesaes we call cancer in Kenya that is causing more and more deaths.

Discaimer:
The data is random based and is purely for the purposes of my coursework, demonstarting my level of expertise in data analysis. This is my first project. 

# Research Problem
The data set can be found in the attached files which I got from the National Bureau of Statistics through an API. It contains the necessary information, including the varios regions, prevalence according to gender, nature of cancer, anf total. I have used the Kenyan population dataset as part of my analysis. In order to conclusively analyze and draw insights from the data, I will follow these steps:

    -Define the question, the metrics for success, the context
    -Consider the appropriateness of the data.
    -Data Cleaning: Find and deal with outliers, anomalies and missing data
    -Create visualizations that help with interpretation of analysed data
    -Draw conclusions from various data findings
