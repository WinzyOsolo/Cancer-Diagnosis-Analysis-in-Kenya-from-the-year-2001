# Overview and Business Understanding
The objective of this data science project is to analyze and derive inights on the diagnosis and prevalence of Cancer in Kenya from the year 2001. The project aims to create value to various stakeholders within the healthcare industry, medical researchers, the Kenyan government and the World Health Organisation. This research is important because the the better we understand this disease, the more progress we will make as a country in diminishing the tremendous human and economic tolls of cancer. 
The purpose is to: -Develop safe and effective methods to prevent, detect and diagnose, treat and ultimately, cure the collection of disesaes we call cancer in Kenya that is causing more and more deaths.

#Data Source and Suitability
The data set can be found from the National Bureau of Statistics. It contains the necessary information, including the varios regions, prevalence according to gender, nature of cancer, anf total. I have used the Kenyan population dataset as part of my analysis. In order to conclusively analyze and draw insights from the data, I followed these steps:

#Major Beneficiaries of the Findings
- Healthcare sector, to provide appropriate healrhcare solutions
- Researchers and Scientists espectally Cancer Researchers who can create more targeted solutions to the cancer problem inKenya
- The Government to create strategies that fit the problem

# Understanding the Problem
Specifying the Data Analysis Question
- Which are the top ten most prevalent type of Cancer in Kenya
- Regional Analysis of the top five most prevalent cancer
- Top five types of cancers affecting Men
- Top five types of cancers affecting Women
- Which type of cancer causes most deaths

# Data Analysis and Visualization
- The Top 10 Most Prevalent Cancers in Kenya

The dataset includes various types of cancers, ranging from breast and lung to cervix, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and prostate. Breast cancer has the highest number of cases, followed by Oesophagus, Melanoma, Lung, and Ovary. This suggests that breast cancer is the most prevalent type among the given dataset.
Overall, this data highlights the significance of understanding cancer prevalence to develop targeted prevention strategies, improve healthcare services, and enhance public health interventions to combat cancer effectively.

-Regional Analusis of the top five most prevanet cancers

Each type of cancer has varying distributions across different regions. For example, Breast cancer has the highest incidence in Nairobi and Central regions, while Melanoma is more prevalent in Nairobi and Rift Valley. This suggests that the distribution of cancer cases may be influenced by factors such as population demographics, healthcare access, environmental conditions, and lifestyle factors prevalent in each region.

- Top five types of cancers affecting men

The data indicates that certain types of cancer have a higher incidence among males compared to females. For example, Lung cancer has the highest incidence among males, followed by Oesophagus, Melanoma, Prostate, and Anal cancers. Understanding the prevalence of these male-specific cancers is crucial for developing targeted prevention and intervention strategies.

- Top five types of cancers affecting women

The data indicates that certain types of cancer have a higher incidence among females compared to males. For example, Breast cancer has the highest incidence among females, followed by Melanoma, Oesophagus, Ovary, and Cervical cancer. This suggests the importance of gender-specific approaches in cancer prevention, screening, and treatment.

Which type of cancer causes most deaths


The data on cancer-related deaths provides valuable insights into the burden of different types of cancer on mortality rates and underscores the importance of multifaceted strategies for cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment to reduce the impact of cancer on public health.

# Conclusion and Recommendations
There is need for:
-Implementing evidence-based strategies for cancer prevention, promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors, increasing access to cancer screening and early detection services, and ensuring timely and appropriate treatment for individuals diagnosed with cancer.
-Tailored Approaches to Cancer Care 
-Healthcare Access and Awareness
-Identification and mitigation of lifestyle and environmental factors contributing to the prevalence of cancer in Kenya
-Identification of Potential Risk Factors for various cancers and creation of awareness.
